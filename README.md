In this I have demonstrate how to build a linear slider code component in D365 Sales Hub that enables users to change 
the numeric values using a visual slider instead of typing the values in the column.

For this Project the below are the pre requisites 
1.Visual Studio Code (VSCode) (Ensure the Add to PATH option is select)
2.node.js (LTS version is recommended)
3.Microsoft Power Platform CLI (Use either Power Platform Tools for Visual Studio Code or Power Platform CLI for Windows)
4.DOTNET Build tools by installing one of the following: (At minimum select the workload .NET build tools.)
Visual Studio 2019

Note
You may prefer to use the .NET 6.x SDK instead of the Build Tools for Visual Studio. In this case, instead of using msbuild you would use dotnet build.

For more refrence you may visit the official microsoft from where I've build this
